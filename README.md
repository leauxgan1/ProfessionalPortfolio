## How to test and run

Start by cloning the repository to a local directory

From inside the directory, run the following command to build the website.

```bash
npm run astro build
```

Then, run the next command to run a local server which will serve the website.

```bash
npm run astro dev
```

This will open up a port on localhost:4321, unless that port is already in use.

In the case that the port is in use, check the terminal to see the proper port number to fetch.

From there, the page is available and can be navigated from the navigation bar at the top of the screen.
